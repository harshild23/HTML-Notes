<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
<p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.</p>
<p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</p><br>
<h3>What Are HTML Tags?</h3>
<p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: h1.</p>
<p>Most tags must be opened h1 and closed /h1 in order to function.</p><br>
<h3>What are HTML Attributes?</h3>
<p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside</p><br>
<h4>An example of an attribute is:</h4>
<p>img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog."</p><br>
<p> !DOCTYPE html — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.</p>
<p> html — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.</p>
<p> head — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.</p>
<p> body — This is where the content of the page goes.</p>
<p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading.</p>
<p>HTML paragraphs are defined with the p tag.</p>
<p>The br tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.</p>
<p>The a tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.</p>
<p>The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed. The img tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels).</p><br>
<h4>HTML Formatting Elements</h4>
<ul>
<li> b - Bold text</li>
<li> strong - Important text</li>
<li> i - Italic text</li>
<li> em - Emphasized text</li>
<li> mark - Marked text</li>
<li> small - Smaller text</li>
<li> del - Deleted text</li>
<li> ins - Inserted text</li>
<li> sub - Subscript text</li>
<li> sup - Superscript text</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>HTML Table</h4>
<p>The table tag defines an HTML table.</p>
<p>Each table row is defined with a tr tag. Each table header is defined with a th tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a td tag.</p>
<p>By default, the text in th elements are bold and centered.</p>
<p>By default, the text in td elements are regular and left-aligned.</p><br>
<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
<p>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p><br>
<h3>Inline CSS</h3>
<p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</p>
<p>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</p><br>
<h3>Internal CSS</h3>
<p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</p>
<p>An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.</p><br>
<h3>External CSS</h3>
<p>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.</p>
<p>To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head section of each HTML page.</p><br>
<h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
<p>The CSS syntax consists of a set of rules. These rules have 3 parts: a selector, a property, and a value.</p>
<p>===<b>>  selector { property: value }</b></p>
<p>Example: h1 { color: blue }</p><br>
<h4>CSS Selectors</h4>
<ul>
<li> Type selector - h1 {  }</li>
<p>Selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>
<li> Universal selector - * {  }</li>
<p>Selects all HTML elements on the page.</p>
<li> Class selector - .box {  }</li>
<p>Selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
<li> Id selector - #unique { }</li>
<p>Selects an element with a specific id.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Grouping Selectors</h4>
<p>We can apply a style to many selectors if we like. Just separate the selectors with a comma.
	Example: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: blue }</p>
<h4>Applying Multiple Properties</h4>
<p>	To apply more than one property separate each declaration with a semi-colon.
	Example: h1 { color: blue; font-family: arial, helvetica, "sans serif"; font-size: 150%; }</p><br>
<h4>DIV: The Content Division element</h4>
<p>The div HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS.</p>
<p>As a "pure" container, the div element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.</p><br>
<h4>CSS Properties</h4>
<p>Some of the mainly used properties are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li> border - We can set a border for all four sides of a box</li>
<li> border-top - We can set a border for top side of a box</li>
<li> border-width - We can set the width of border</li>
<li> border-style - We can set the style of border</li>
<li> border-color - We can set the color of border</li>
<li> background-color - We can set the color for background</li>
<li> background-image - We can set the image for background</li>
<li> background-size - We can set the size of background image</li>
<li> background-position - We can set the position of background image</li>
<li> font-size: - We can set the size of the text</li>
<li> font-family: - We can set the font of the text</li>
<li> text-align: - We can set the allignment of the text</li>
<li> color - We can set the color of the text</li>
<li> background-position - We can set the position of background image</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.</p>
<p>JavaScript helps the users to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS. It is mainly used in web applications.</p>
<p>JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage. On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors. Using JavaScript, it is also possible to load the content in a document without reloading the webpage.</p><br>
<h4>What is JavaScript used for?</h4>
<p><b>Adding interactive behavior to web pages</b></p>
<p>JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li> Show or hide more information with the click of a button</li>
<li> Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it</li>
<li> Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage</li>
<li> Zooming in or zooming out on an image</li>
<li> Displaying a timer or count-down on a website</li>
<li> Playing audio and video in a web page</li>
<li> Displaying animations</li>
<li> Using a drop-down menu</li>
</ul><br>
<p><b>Advantages of JavaScript:</b></p>
<p>The merits of using JavaScript are −</p>
<ul>
<li> Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</li>
<li> Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</li>
<li> Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.</li>
<li> Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</li>
</ul><br>
