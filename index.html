<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
<p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.</p>
<p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</p><br>
<h3>What Are HTML Tags?</h3>
<p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: h1.</p>
<p>Most tags must be opened h1 and closed /h1 in order to function.</p><br>
<h3>What are HTML Attributes?</h3>
<p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside</p><br>
<h4>An example of an attribute is:</h4>
<p>img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog."</p><br>
<p> !DOCTYPE html — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.</p>
<p> html — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.</p>
<p> head — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.</p>
<p> body — This is where the content of the page goes.</p>
<p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags. h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading.</p>
<p>HTML paragraphs are defined with the p tag.</p>
<p>The br tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.</p>
<p>The a tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.</p>
<p>The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed. The img tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels).</p><br>
<h4>HTML Formatting Elements</h4>

<h4>HTML Table</h4>
<p>The table tag defines an HTML table.</p>
<p>Each table row is defined with a tr tag. Each table header is defined with a th tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a td tag.</p>
<p>By default, the text in th elements are bold and centered.</p>
<p>By default, the text in td elements are regular and left-aligned.</p><br>
<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
<p>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p><br>
<h3>Inline CSS</h3>
<p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</p>
<p>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</p><br>
<h3>Internal CSS</h3>
<p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</p>
<p>An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.</p><br>
<h3>External CSS</h3>

<p>To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head section of each HTML page.</p>
